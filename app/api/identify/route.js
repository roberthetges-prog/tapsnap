// v3 adds toilet/cistern vocabulary. Until now this prompt only knew tapware: it described a
// cistern fill valve perfectly in prose, then had to file it under category "Other" and fixture ""
// because those were the only words it had - and brands like Geberit, Fluidmaster, WDI and R&T
// weren't even in its list. The match still worked, carried by the fingerprint, but the two stages
// disagreed about what they were looking at. Now they don't.
//
// The single most important new job: telling an INLET valve from an OUTLET valve. They live in the
// same cistern, a metre apart, and they are not interchangeable.
